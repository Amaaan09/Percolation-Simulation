# Percolation Simulation
This is a simple percolation simulation program written in Python. It uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate the percolation process on a square grid with blocked and open sites. The program can be used to study the behavior of percolation clusters and to estimate the percolation threshold for different grid sizes.

## Requirements
To run this program, you will need:

-Python 3.6 or higher

-NumPy and Matplotlib libraries

## Usage
visit https://percolation-simulation.streamlit.app/

## Outputs
The program generates two outputs:

-A result where it shows where if the grid has been percolated or not and how many sites it opened

-A plot of the percolation grid, where black represents open sites and white represents blocked sites.
