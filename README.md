# Percolation Simulation
This is a simple percolation simulation program written in Python. It uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate the percolation process on a square grid with blocked and open sites. The program can be used to study the behavior of percolation clusters and to estimate the percolation threshold for different grid sizes.

## Requirements
To run this program, you will need:

-Python 3.6 or higher

-NumPy and Matplotlib libraries

## Usage
visit https://percolation-simulation.streamlit.app/

## Outputs
The program generates two outputs:

A plot of the percolation process, where blue represents open sites and white represents blocked sites. The percolation cluster is highlighted in yellow.
The percolation threshold, which is the probability that the cluster percolates (i.e., spans the entire grid) for a given grid size.
